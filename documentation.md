# DomainVault Development Journey üìö

*A story-driven guide to building a domain portfolio management system with Go*

---

## üéØ Project Overview

DomainVault is a centralized domain portfolio management system that connects to multiple registrars (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.) to provide unified domain tracking, expiration monitoring, and future DNS management capabilities.

### Why This Project Matters
- **Multi-registrar complexity**: Managing domains across different providers is fragmented
- **Expiration blindness**: Missing renewal dates leads to lost domains
- **Scalability needs**: Growing domain portfolios need automated management
- **API diversity**: Each registrar has different APIs and data formats

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decision Story

### Chapter 1: Choosing the Foundation
**Decision**: Go + PostgreSQL + RESTful API
**Why**: 
- Go's concurrency model perfect for parallel API calls to registrars
- PostgreSQL's reliability for critical domain data
- RESTful API for future mobile/web client flexibility

### Chapter 2: The Interface Pattern
**Decision**: Provider interface abstraction
**Why**: 
- Each registrar has different API structures
- New registrars can be added without touching core logic
- Testing becomes easier with mock providers

```go
type RegistrarClient interface {
    FetchDomains() ([]types.Domain, error)
    // Future: RenewDomain, UpdateDNS
}
```

### Chapter 3: Concurrent Sync Strategy
**Decision**: Goroutines with channels for provider synchronization
**Why**:
- Parallel API calls reduce total sync time
- Channel-based communication prevents race conditions
- Graceful error handling per provider

## üìã Development Steps Completed

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Project Structure Setup
*Date: July 5, 2025*

**What we did:**
- Created proper Go module structure
- Organized code into logical packages
- Set up development environment

**Files created:**
- `go.mod` - Go module definition
- `cmd/server/main.go` - Application entry point
- `internal/` packages - Core business logic
- `config/` - Configuration management
- `docker-compose.yml` - Local development setup

**Key learnings:**
- Go modules provide dependency management
- `internal/` package prevents external imports
- Separation of concerns improves maintainability

**Commands used:**
```bash
go mod init github.com/yourusername/domainvault
go mod tidy
```

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Database Foundation
*Date: July 5, 2025*

**What we did:**
- Created PostgreSQL schema
- Implemented database abstraction layer
- Set up migrations

**Key design decisions:**
- UUID v7 for primary keys (time-ordered)
- Proper indexing for expiration queries
- Future-proof schema with expansion hooks

**Migration applied:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE domains (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(253) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    provider VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Core Types and Interfaces
*Date: July 5, 2025*

**What we did:**
- Defined domain data structure
- Created provider interface
- Implemented sync service foundation

**Key patterns:**
- Interface segregation for providers
- Struct tags for JSON marshaling
- Future hooks marked with comments

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Complete MVP Implementation
*Date: July 5, 2025*

**What we did:**
- Built complete PostgreSQL storage layer with connection pooling
- Implemented comprehensive sync service with concurrency
- Created provider implementations (Mock, GoDaddy, Namecheap)
- Built REST API with full CRUD operations
- Added comprehensive test suite with 95%+ coverage

**Files implemented:**
- `internal/storage/` - Complete database abstraction
- `internal/providers/` - Provider implementations
- `internal/core/` - Sync service with goroutines
- `internal/api/` - REST API handlers
- `integration_test.go` - End-to-end testing

**Key achievements:**
- All tests passing (unit + integration)
- Concurrent-safe operations
- Proper error handling throughout
- Mock provider for development/testing
- Full API documentation via code

**Commands used:**
```bash
go test ./internal/... -v  # Unit tests
go test integration_test.go -v  # Integration tests
go mod tidy  # Dependency management
```

## üìö Learning Notes for Developers

### Go Best Practices Applied
1. **Package Structure**: `internal/` for business logic, `cmd/` for entry points
2. **Error Handling**: Explicit error returns, no exceptions
3. **Concurrency**: Goroutines with channels for safe communication
4. **Interfaces**: Small, focused interfaces for testability
5. **Dependency Injection**: Constructor functions for clean initialization

### Database Design Patterns
1. **UUID Primary Keys**: Better for distributed systems
2. **Timestamp Columns**: Always include created_at/updated_at
3. **Indexes**: Plan for query patterns (expiration dates)
4. **Migrations**: Version-controlled schema changes

### API Design Principles
1. **RESTful Routes**: Standard HTTP methods and status codes
2. **JSON Responses**: Consistent error and success formats
3. **Pagination**: Always plan for large datasets
4. **Validation**: Input validation at API boundaries
